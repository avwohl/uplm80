# Changelog

Notable changes to uplm80. Releases before 0.3.2 are described on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/avwohl/uplm80/releases).

## 0.3.3 — 2026-09-19

Two code-generation defects that silently produced wrong Z80, plus the PL/M
string-literal fix that comes with the raised `uplox` floor. Both code
generation defects are present in every earlier release; commit 273c83a made
them reachable rather than introducing them.

### Fixed

- **A BYTE `>` comparison used as a value was non-zero when false.** In
  `_gen_byte_comparison_const` and `_gen_byte_comparison` the `GT` arm jumped
  to the join label that follows `ld a,0ffh`, not to the `xor a` false case,
  which left the `xor a` unreachable and the compared operand sitting in the
  accumulator. `Y = X > 32` with `X = 6` assigned 6 instead of 0. The arm now
  branches to a real false label.
- **Register `B` was clobbered while the other operand of a byte `AND`, `OR`,
  `XOR` or `SUB` was generated.** `_gen_byte_binary` and
  `_gen_byte_comparison` parked one operand in `B` with `ld b,a` and then
  generated the other operand. `B` is not callee-saved, a nested byte
  comparison uses `ld b,a` as its own scratch move, and a procedure call in
  the other operand overwrites `B`, so the closing `and b` masked against
  garbage: `D = (A > 0) AND (B < C)` with `A = 0` came out true. The operand
  is now spilled through the stack, and `B` is loaded only once the other
  operand has been generated. `pop bc` would be shorter than `ld b,a` plus
  `pop af`, but `pop bc` also overwrites `C`, where the CP/M call convention
  keeps a live argument - `CALL MON1(2, '0' + X)` became a call to BDOS
  function 68.

  Both defects only reach the generated code when a comparison is
  materialised as a value. Commit 273c83a, which correctly made PL/M-80's
  `AND` and `OR` bitwise rather than short-circuit, routed every `IF` and
  `DO WHILE` condition through that path, so the two defects went from latent
  to load-bearing. Standalone programs demonstrate both under 0.3.1 as well.

### Changed

- `uplox` floor raised to `>=3.3.1`, and `uplm80/_plm_parser.py` regenerated
  against that grammar. A backslash inside a PL/M character literal - MBASIC's
  integer-divide token, for one - no longer fails with
  `lexical error at byte 0x5c`. PL/M-80 has no backslash escape.

### Known issues

- Code generated for the CrLZH decoder of the 80un CP/M unpacker is still
  wrong. A bisect puts the first failure at bdb0f8a "Implement register
  tracking phases 3-5", where `lzh$get$byte` parked its accumulator in `DE`
  across a call to `lzh$get$bit`; that particular defect is gone from the
  current generator, whose `LZHGETBYTE` matches the pre-bdb0f8a output
  instruction for instruction. A later, separate defect in the same area
  remains, somewhere in the plox front-end migration range, and the commits
  in that range cannot be built against a current `uplox` to narrow it
  further. Until the defect is found, 80un builds its released binary with
  uplm80 01cfcc6.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-08-20

No change to the compiler since 0.3.1. This release raises one dependency
floor and corrects two documentation items.

### Changed

- `uplox` floor raised to `>=3.3.0`, so a fresh install resolves the parser
  runtime that uplm80 is actually developed against rather than 3.2.0.
  3.3.0 adds the classifier lookahead window and named LR-state sets and
  fixes an IELR backward-propagation bug that could trip a table-build
  assertion.
- `sample_code/CPM_source/1,1/origin.txt` now points at
  `https://www.icl1900.co.uk/...` — z80pack's sources moved off
  `autometer.de`, and the recorded provenance URL no longer resolved.
- The Related Projects section of the README was rewritten in Simplified
  Technical English.

The `upeepz80` floor stays at `>=0.2.3`; nothing in that package changed.
